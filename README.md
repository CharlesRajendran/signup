# Nodejs Unit Testing

### What is Unit Testing?
- Unit Testing is defined as a type of software testing where individual units/components of a software are tested.
- Unit Testing of software applications is done during the development (coding) of an application.
- The objective of Unit Testing is to isolate a section of code and verify its correctness.

### Why we need Unit Testing?
- Unit Tests fix bug early in development cycle and save costs.
- Good unit tests serve as project documentation
- Confidently refactor or update the function

<hr />

### Pros and Cons of Unit Testing
- #### Pros
  - Can ensure code quality
  - Regression management
  - Better understanding of the code. Testing it will reveal cases you did not anticipate and will help define the behavior of the code
  - Other developers can understand the code easily

- #### Cons
  - Time Consuming
  - Learning Curve

### What is TDD (Red Green Refactor Method)?
- A programming practice that instructs developers to write new code only if an automated test has failed.
- Test-Driven Development starts with designing and developing tests for every small functionality of an application.

- #### How to perform TDD Test
    Following steps define how to perform TDD test,

    1. Add a test.
    2. Run all tests and see if any new test fails.
    3. Write some code.
    4. Run tests and Refactor code.
    5. Repeat.

- #### TDD Principles
  - You can't write any production code until you have first written a failing unit test.
  - You can't write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing.
  - You can't write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing unit test.

- ### Why I choose jest for the testing framework
  - Test Runner + Assertion Library
  - Easy Configuration
  - Rich set of API's
  - Good developer community (Also managed by Facebook)

### What is BDD?
- An extension to TDD
- Writing test in a more readable manner
- Instead of implementation we write test for scenarios

### Agenda for the Demo
- #### Matchers
  - Pure Functions
  - AAA Principle

- #### Mocking
  - API Mocking
- #### Setup and Tear Down
- #### Code Coverage
